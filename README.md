## Getting Started

To run Silentmoon on your local machine, follow these steps:

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AlpayC/Fullstack_Abschlussprojekt_SilentMoon.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd silentmoon
   ```

3. Install frontend and backend dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The frontend server will run on http://localhost:3000 and the backend server will run on http://localhost:3001.

2. Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

3. Register a new account or log in with the following credentials:

   ```bash
   email:
    password:
   ```

4. Explore the app!

## API Integration

The Silentmoon app integrates with the Spotify API to provide meditation music. To set up Spotify integration:

1. Create a Spotify Developer account and create a new app to get your API credentials.

2. In the `root` directory, create a `.env` file and add your Spotify API credentials:

   ```
   SPOTIFY_ID=your_client_id
   SPOTIFY_=your_client_secret
   ```

3. Add the following credentials `.env` file for the JWT token with `require("crypto").randomBytes(64).toString("hex")`:

   ```
   TOKEN_SECRET= your_token_secret
   ```

4. Add the following credentials `.env` file for the MongoDB connection:

   ```
   DB=your_mongodb_connection string (e.g. mongodb://localhost:27017/silentmoon)
   PORT=3000
   ```

5. Later add the following credentials `.env` file for the Render connection within the Node server:

   ```
   VITE_BACKEND_URL
   RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL
   ```

## Database

The Silentmoon app uses MongoDB to store user data. The database is hosted on MongoDB Atlas. The app uses the `mongoose` library to connect to the database. The app uses the `dotenv` library to load environment variables from the `.env` file. The app uses the `nodemon` library to automatically restart the server when changes are made to the code. The app uses the `morgan` library to log HTTP requests. The Videos are stored on `cloudinary`.

## Authentication

The Silentmoon app uses JWT authentication. The app generates a JWT token when a user registers or logs in. The token is stored in local storage and is used to authenticate the user for protected routes. The token is valid for 24 hours. The app uses the `jsonwebtoken` library to generate and verify tokens. The app uses the `bcrypt` library to hash passwords. The app uses the `axios` library to make HTTP requests.
